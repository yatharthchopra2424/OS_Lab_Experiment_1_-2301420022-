```

## Task Details

- **Task 1**: Process Creation Utility - Fork 3 children, print PIDs and PPIDs
- **Task 2**: Command Execution Using exec() - Execute ls -l command in child process
- **Task 3**: Zombie & Orphan Processes - Simulate defunct zombie and orphaned child processes
- **Task 4**: Inspecting Process Info from /proc - Parse process status, executable path, and file descriptors
- **Task 5**: Process Prioritization - Demonstrate CPU scheduling with different nice values

## How to Run

```bash
python process_management.py
```
